Rails project, party just to see what I can build in a short space of time, partly for college.

This prototype application implemented in the Ruby on Rails framework includes  functionalities such as forum for discussion, various types of user profiles including permissions and profile page showing activity, a project and task management function with up-to-date information on task status, ability to pledge/volunteer
The project has explored how to integrate current technologies like AuthLogic Authentication, Twitter Bootstrap with Ruby on Rails.  It makes use of gems such as acts-as-taggable, and also features my own gem LinkAdd, to make certain keywords clickable.
